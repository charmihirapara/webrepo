            ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
            ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
        - sudo nano /etc/nginx/snippets/ssl-params.conf
            ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;
            ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
            ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/dhparam.pem;
            ssl_ciphers EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM;
            ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;
            ssl_session_timeout  10m;
            ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;

            resolver 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 valid=300s;
            resolver_timeout 5s;
            # Disable strict transport security for now. You can uncomment the following

            add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
            add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
            add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
